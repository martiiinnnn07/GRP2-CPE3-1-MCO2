Taal Lake, located in Batangas, Philippines, is a freshwater volcanic lake within a caldera formed by prehistoric eruptions. The lake's ecosystem is uniquely influenced by volcanic activity and environmental factors, making it a crucial site for water quality monitoring. Understanding parameters such as pH, dissolved oxygen, and pollutant levels helps protect aquatic life, support local fisheries, and maintain safe water standards for nearby communities. This study leverages data mining and machine learning to predict water quality trends and support sustainable lake management
